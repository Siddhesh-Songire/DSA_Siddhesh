/*
* Compilation error
syntax error;

* Memory limit exceeded
size exceeded as per constraints;

* Runtime error or segmentation error
1) illegal access of memory ex- accessing a[n] 
2) undefined behaviou (4/0)
A common error that is caused by an out-of-scope array index that is causing a buffer overflow or an incorrectly initialized pointer etc.

Generated when a program tries to read or write the data that is 
outside the memory that is allocated for it or to write memory
that can only be read.
For example, accessing a [-1] in a language which does not support
negative indices for an array will throw this error.


! Compilation time and execution time
In competative sites time given is execution time, size of code d.p.t compilation time
we can determine execution time using Time complexity

* TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)
Raised by the program when your program is too slow

* Error in recurssion:
 There can be 2 type of errors :
 1) TLE -> when code take more than given time to execute
 2) Runtime error -> when stack gets full before time limit get exceded;
